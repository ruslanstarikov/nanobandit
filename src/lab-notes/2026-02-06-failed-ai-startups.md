## Failed AI Startups: The Ones That Looked Promising and Then Disappeared

The AI boom produced thousands of startups. Many raised money, launched products, got press — and then quietly died. This article looks at AI startups that were noticed, hyped, or funded, but failed to reach escape velocity.

### Adept AI
**What they built:** AI agents that could operate software
**Outcome:** Team partially acqui-hired by Amazon, product discontinued
**Lesson:** Competing at the foundation-model layer without hyperscale economics is fatal.

### Humane (AI Pin)
**What they built:** Wearable AI assistant
**Outcome:** Product effectively dead by mid-2024
**Lesson:** AI does not fix bad hardware or unclear use cases.

### Inflection AI
**What they built:** Pi, a personal AI companion
**Outcome:** Majority of team acqui-hired by Microsoft
**Lesson:** Companion AI without monetization is not viable.

### Stability AI (Collapse Phase)
**What they built:** Stable Diffusion
**Outcome:** Near-collapse, restructuring, leadership removed
**Lesson:** Open-source adoption without revenue is unsustainable.

### Rewind AI (Consumer Vision)
**What they built:** Personal memory capture
**Outcome:** Consumer vision abandoned, pivoted
**Lesson:** Viral demos are not businesses.

### Essay Generator Startups (Caktus AI etc.)
**Outcome:** Revenue collapse after policy and detection changes
**Lesson:** Products built on rule-breaking die fast.

### SMB Chatbot Graveyard
Hundreds of thin ChatGPT wrappers launched and shut down in 2024.

**Lesson:** Undifferentiated wrappers have zero defensibility.

## Common Failure Patterns
- High infra costs
- No moat
- Weak customer pain
- Demo-driven hype

## Final Takeaway
The AI gold rush punished novelty and rewarded painful, boring problems with real budgets.
