### Adept AI

- **What they built:** AI agents that could operate software
- **Why it mattered:** Seen as a real OpenAI competitor
- **Outcome:** Team partially acqui-hired by Amazon, product discontinued
- **Lesson:** Competing at the foundation layer without hyperscale economics is fatal

### Humane (AI Pin)

- **What they built:** Wearable AI assistant
- **Why it mattered:** Ex-Apple founders, massive hype
- **Outcome:** Product effectively shut down, layoffs
- **Lesson:** AI does not fix bad hardware UX

### Inflection AI

- **What they built:** Pi, a personal AI companion
- **Why it mattered:** High-profile team and funding
- **Outcome:** Team acqui-hired by Microsoft, product sunset
- **Lesson:** Pleasant conversation is not a business model
