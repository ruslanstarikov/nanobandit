## Scope
This lab note looks at **end-user LLM usage** (non-builders, non-API users) based on app popularity, public usage data, and observed behaviour across 2024–2026.

“People” here means individuals using finished products: web apps, desktop apps, and mobile apps.

---

## High-level finding

**End users overwhelmingly use LLMs via chat interfaces.**

Non-chat LLM applications exist, but they are fragmented, niche, or embedded in other products. The dominant mental model for LLMs in 2026 is still: *a text box and a send button*.

---

## Most popular LLM apps (overall)

### Tier 1: Mass-market, general purpose

These apps dominate global end-user usage by a wide margin.

- **ChatGPT** — Free + Paid
- **Gemini (Google)** — Free + Paid
- **Claude** — Free + Paid
- **Microsoft Copilot** — Free + Paid

These four account for the majority of consumer LLM usage worldwide.

## Chat apps

### What people use them for

- Asking questions
- Writing and rewriting text
- Explaining concepts
- Summarising documents
- Brainstorming ideas
- Light coding help
- Replacing Google for some queries

### Popular chat-based LLM apps

**Free + Paid**
- ChatGPT
- Gemini
- Claude
- Microsoft Copilot

**Paid / Pro-leaning**
- Perplexity (search-first chat)
- Poe (multi-model chat for power users)

Even products marketed as “search” still use a **chat-style UX**.

## Non-chat LLM apps

Non-chat usage exists, but it is far more fragmented.

### Writing and content tools

- Grammarly (Free + Paid)
- Jasper (Paid)
- Notion AI (Paid add-on)
- Microsoft Word / Google Docs AI (Paid tiers)

Many users do not consciously think of these as “LLM apps”, even though they are.

### Image and media generation

- Midjourney (Paid)
- DALL·E (Free + Paid, often via ChatGPT)
- Runway (Paid)

These are prompt-based but not conversational.

### Productivity and automation

- Otter (Free + Paid)
- Fireflies (Paid)
- GitHub Copilot (Paid)
- Linear / project-management AI features (Paid)

LLMs here are typically **embedded**, not the primary product.

### Education

- Khanmigo (Paid)
- Duolingo Max (Paid)
- Quizlet AI (Free + Paid)

---

## Paid vs free usage

- Free tiers dominate discovery and casual use
- Many users never convert to paid
- Paid users are mostly professionals, students, or power users

Importantly, **paid usage is still mostly chat-based**.

---

## What people are not doing

Despite hype, most end users are *not*:

- Running autonomous agents daily
- Building chains or workflows
- Treating LLMs as complex multi-step tools

These patterns are far more common among builders than end users.

---

## Conclusion

For end users in 2026:

- LLMs are primarily conversational tools
- Chat remains the dominant interface
- Non-chat LLMs succeed when embedded into existing workflows

The simplest interface continues to win.
